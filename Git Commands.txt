=====================================================

to create a new branch:

1)  git branch copybranch
2) git checkout copybranch  ( top point your working directory to copybranch)

to merge the single branch together:

if you are present on the your copybranch
1)  git checkout master
2)  git merge copybranch
3) ifyou want to sync the changes between the working directory (here, master) to --> remote repos
   git push origin master

=====================================================

git fetch is used to sync the changes between the remote repos and local repos only and then you have to do reabsing to sync the changes between the local repos and working directory

git pull is direct syncing the changes between the remote repos and working direcotory via local repos

Sytax:
delete/modify some file from the remote repos

1) git fetch  = soft delte
2) git rebase origin/master

=====================================

git fetch is done if you want to modify the file recrusively so keep your file on local repos only for pushing directly 
by mistake some body deleetd the file from your remote repos so dont pull just ue fetch to keep your changes limited till loca repos only
